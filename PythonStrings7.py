# 7. Interactive Help Desk Bot
# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to create an interactive help desk bot that processes user queries and responds appropriately for a SaaS application.

# Task 1: Command Parser
# Write a script that takes a user's text input and identifies if it contains one of the predefined commands (e.g., "help", "issue", "contact support"). If a command is found, print a response related to the command.

# Task 2: Issue Categorizer
# If the user's input contains the word "issue", further categorize the issue based on keywords such as "login", "performance", "error", etc. Print out the category of the issue for the support team.

# Task 3: Auto-Response Generator
# For general help inquiries, create a script that generates an auto-response providing links to the FAQ section, support contact information, and a link to submit a ticket.
